Coming wine mod for minecraft

I am working on a mod for Minecraft that adds wine to the game.
There are some mods for wine in Minecraft, but they either require an older version of Minecraft, witht he right combination of Forge,
individual libraries or even on the Fabric side; certain versions of their own libraries and minecraft versions.

Those individuals who made Fabric versions have made Forge versions that are compeltely broken and obvisouly not playtested by themselves
and receive feedback with "...I am working on it and will release it soon..." while continuing to release Fabric versions.

I belive Forge is the better way to go as it works more closely with the Minecraft API and is more mature inits idealogy, more stable and
potentially more performant.

This is going to be a slow process, as the last time I made any kind of mod for Minecraft was long before 1.12 and a lot has changed since. I
am also starting a new job soon, so time deditated to developing and playtesting as I work, not to mention developing assets (I am not a 
graphics person) is going to take a while.
